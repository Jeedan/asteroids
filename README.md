# Guided Project on Boot.dev

This is a guided project on Boot.dev where we ended up creating a simple Asteroids clone.

- We used pygame for the basic game loop and sprite generation and other game engine/library methods.
- In the project we learned to spawn objects, such as player, asteroids and bullets.
- We learned to use pygames inputs to move and shoot. 
- We learned how to setup a basic game loop using delta time for updating and syncing between frames.
- We learned how to detect collision, in this project we used circle collision by checking how close we are to another object based on our radius.
